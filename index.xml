&lt;p>I have improved slightly upon his method, creating a simple Python script to download the equation images prior to publication and serving them from the local web server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>This site was based on the hugo-xmin theme.</description></item></channel></rss>
