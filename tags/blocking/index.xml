The inclusion of ads on smart TVs even by well known brands like &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/ads-in-smart-tv">Samsung, Sony and LG&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112014902/https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/ads-in-smart-tv">archive&lt;/a>) significantly increases the need for forced DNS adblocking of devices that deliberately ignore DHCP provided DNS.
A Pihole DNS by itself can prevent ads from devices that are well behaved, but misbehaving devices will have to be forced by either a firewall or router.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
